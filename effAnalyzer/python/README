# The normal jpsi.py is the one which runs of the inclusive jpsi sample
# Th trigger efficiency is tested for the incoherent, inclusive Jpsi plus the GGtoMuMu MC sample 
The Jpsi samples are failed to reproduce the proper efficiencies since a forward selection is implemented from the very beginning of the sample production 
After realizing that we finally moved to the GGtoMuMu sample
